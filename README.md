# classroom_utils

Imagine you are an instructor at a university or school and want to use GitHub to manage exams and projects with your
students. The classroom_utils will help you to automate repetitive processes like assigning students to a certain organization,
granting read or write access to repos or creating personal repos for all class members.

## Installation

You can install the classroom_utils as a python module from pypi via pip with the following command:

    pip install classroom-utils

To make life on Windows a little bit easier you can also use the prebuild version as a self contained binary that ships
with the python interpreter itself and all dependencies.
